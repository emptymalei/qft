Principle of Least Action and Equation of Motion
===========================================================


We will talk about several topics in this chapter.

1. Principle of least action;
2. Derive the equation of motion using Lagrangian or Lagrangian density: Klein-Gordon equation, Dirac equation; Maxwell equation; Equation of motion for massive particles, Shrodinger equation;
3. Relation to statistical mechanics.
